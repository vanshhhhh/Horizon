Horizon is a web application for NASA Space Apps Challenge ☀️

Data about the Sun has enabled us to learn more about Space Weather.
We have created an interactive tool to visualize the Solar Flux data in a new and inviting way that improves public knowledge and understanding of space weather

We have used Python programming language and utilised Streamlit framework to make web application,
Pandas library for data collection, and manipulation and Streamlit cloud for deploying the web application
